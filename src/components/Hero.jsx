          As a passionate programmer and computing lecturer, I love bringing
          ideas to life and sharing my knowledge and experience with students.
          My love for programming extends beyond teaching, as I enjoy building
          websites and pushing boundaries to find creative solutions. I'm always
          excited to tackle new projects and see what I can achieve.
